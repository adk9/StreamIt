Here are the applications contained in this directory:

AMRadio			An old attempt at an AMRadio (not using now)

BeamFormer		The original Beamformer implementation, which leads
			to buffer overflow.

BeamFormer-fine		More fine-grained Beamformer, which moves some state
			into a filter to prevent exploding I/O ratios.  This
			is what we used for ASPLOS, etc.

Crc			CRC encoder and decoder.

FMRadio			An old FMRadio; new one is in docs/examples/hand/fm.

Gsm			GSM vocoder.

libraries		Miscellaneous library filters used by other apps.

matrixmult		Matrix multiplication.

mp3decoder		Parts of an MP3 decoder (beginning stages still 
			unimplemented since they are variable rate).

PCADemo			An old version of the Beamformer, modeled off of
			unclassified example program from Lincoln Lab
			for DARPA's Polymorphic Computing Architecture (PCA)

perftest4		A performance test from Spectrumware.

specs			Specifications of applications we're implementing.
