** Note: I am assuming that processing the file short_step.wav counts as 1 output, where this is probably far from the truth. 

Uniprocessor (7/29/2002):
(Xenon 2.2 GHz, 512MB cache)
10,000 iterations (1 outputs/iteration)
87.0% utilization
runtime for 10000 iterations = 97.310 seconds

We want cycles/iteration:
10000 iterations/97.310 sec * 
1  outputs/1 iteration
1 second /2.2x10^9 cycles
* 10^5 cycles 

=0.0046711073  outputs/10^5 cycles
