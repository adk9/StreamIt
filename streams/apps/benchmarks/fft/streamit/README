FFT.java - fine-grained decimation-in-time implementation with inputs in bit-reversed order and outputs in natural order  
FFT_inlined.java - inlined syntax version of FFT.java 

FFT3.java - fine-grained decimation-in-time implementation with outputs in bit-reversed order and inputs in natural order 
            (More detailed implementation since it handles real/imag parts and roots of unity weights properly) 
fftref/ - contains C equivalent of FFT3.java (reference implementation) 


FFT2.java - coarse-grained alternate implementation
