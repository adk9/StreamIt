A number of programming languages have included a concept of a stream;
see \cite{survey97} for a survey.  For example, the SVP data model is
a formal framework for collections, which are a generalization of
streams and sets \cite{Par92}.  Kahn presents and analyzes the
semantics of a simple language, consisting of a set of channel and
process declarations, for parallel programming\cite{Kah74}.  Another
popular stream programming language is Occam, which provides channel
communication primitives and both sequential and parallel composition
of communicating processes \cite{Jif93}.  A theoretical framework for
stream processing is $\pi$-calculus.  It formalizes processes, the
active components of the system, channels, and the communication
mechanism\cite{Pie97}.

However, most of these languages are functional instead of imperative.
Further, previous languages are very unstructured, allowing for an
arbitrary connection of blocks and channels that requires considerable
effort to just prove that they are deadlock-free, let alone thinking
about legal stream transformations.
