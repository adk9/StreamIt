Big things to think about
1. operational semantics
2. message sending syntax
3. letting init codes cause an offset (do push() on output)
4. verifying round-robin's are legal by having same rate on both sides

5. semantics for weighted round-robin / duplicates?  or proof of
simulation by a single round-robin.

6. if a stream sends or receives a message, is the wavefront relative
to the output or input?

7. exact semantics of initialization when combining with tapes/messaging.

8. define the path you take in non-i/o connected streams for
messaging.  If they're parallel pieces of split/join, do you
synchronize from above or below?  I think theres's a difference.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Little things to think about
1. would it help to outlaw aliasing?


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future things to think about
1. any notion of exceptions?  error handling?

2. any concept of filters ignoring items?  would affect wavefront (a
select filter, for example.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to write about
1. latency
2. drain/destroy initialization semantics
3. feedback loop initialization
4. portals - let's just adopt templated java lists for the sake of presentation
