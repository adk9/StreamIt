\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
This paper presented StreaMIT, a novel language for the high
performance stream applicaitons.
Stream applications are an emerging class of very important
applicaitons with distinct properties from other recognized
application classes.

StreaMIT attempts to raise the abstraction level in stream
programming, thereby improving programmer productivity and program
robustness. This paper presents fundermental programming constructs
for the Stream application domain. It identifies information flow as
the natural model for reasoning about stream applications. Thus, it
presents a formal definition of the language using of the semantics of
time of StreaMIT. 

The second goal of StreaMIT is to provide a compiler that performs
stream-specific optimizations to achieve the performance of an expert
assembly programmer. Currently, a library-based inplementaiton of
StreaMIT is working. We are starting the development of the first
compiler implementation of StreaMIT. Another area of future reserach
is to develop a clean syntex for StreaMIT. The java-based StreaMIT has
many advantages such as familiarity by programmers, availability of
compiler frameworks and a robust language specification. However, the
resulting StreaMIT syntex is cumbersome.
