\section{Implementation}

The "stream abstraction" vs. the procedural abstraction
-	Separate compilation
-	Black box, vs. gray box vs. white box

Runtime Model
-	Break-up between fine-grain, coarse-grain and black/white boxes etc.
-	Message delivery model

Scripting
-	Partial evaluation
-	Algebraic Simplification 


\subsection{GSM Decoder}

  The decoder portion of the Streamit GSM Vocoder takes GSM encoded
parameters as inputs, and uses these to synthesize audible speech.  This
is accomplished by processing the parameters through four main filters.
The RPE decoder filter produces some "pink noise" that very loosely
estimates the speech waveform, using quantized bit sequences and a
maximum value parameter from the encoded input.  This "pink noise" is
fed to the Long Term Prediction portion, which applies long-term
characteristics to the sequence through a delay filter within a feedback
loop.  The resulting signal is then sent to the Short Term Synthesis
filter, which decodes high frequency voice characteristics from the
encoded parameters and applies these to the signal.  Finally, the
Postprocessing filter identifies peaks in the signal to make it audible.
