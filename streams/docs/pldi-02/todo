things to do with paper:
------------------------

- modify the tape-labeling diagram to have $n$ streams in a parallel split-join

- get correct typesetting for natural numbers N

- add note that the message delivery constraints sometimes specify a
minimum buffer size, sometimes specify a maximum buffer size?

things to figure out / solve:
-----------------------------

- I think the min function is violated when the tapes are empty.
Should probably look at this and see if there's a way to fix it.

- Also, message constraints are violated when things are empty, since
if you require a certain amount of buffering between two filters, then
there won't be that data until initialization time.  hmm.
