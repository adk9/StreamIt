things to do with figures:
--------------------------

- shrink the tape figure, if you want to see it back in the paper

things to do with paper:
------------------------

* mention that we haven't defined semantics of feedback loop

- reverse the order of arguments to min function?

---

- get the f_i % push

- define the mod function

---

* change Ip(i)_J to I_{p(i),J}, esp. if Saman has!!

- note that push_A and pop_A have different tapes

- do \mbox{ } around words in math.

- remove most of the message-constrained scheduling in favor of something
	that's honest but short.

---

- change the "denotational semantics" heading so as not to attract
	denotational semanticists

- include picture of the equalizer in the intro?

- be consistent about RoundRobin vs. Weighted Round Robin

- be consistent about SplitJoin / split-join / split join / splitjoin,
plus capitalization of all stream constructs.

- modify the tape-labeling diagram to have $n$ streams in a parallel split-join

- get correct typesetting for natural numbers N

- add note that the message delivery constraints sometimes specify a
minimum buffer size, sometimes specify a maximum buffer size?

things i'm not likely to do in paper
------------------------------------

- mention limitiation of first-class streams?

- define a max function in the case of the downstream message sending,
just for the sake of making the explanation clearer (and defining the
max function, so that other people can use it in other papers, and
think about the concept even.)

things to figure out / solve:
-----------------------------

*** Can we figure out the denotational semantics for a feedback loop?

*** Can we show that fusion preserves the min function across its
inputs?

* Add the meaning of the whole program to the denotational semantics.

- Add a figure for the feedback loop transformation?  The fusion
transformation?

- Eliminate round robin / weighted round robin (watchout for WeightedRR
in model.tex, too) in favor of just "round robin" that is assumed to
have some weights.

- Introduce comma notation for O1_S => O_1,S, etc.

- Improve the translation from the abstract syntax back to a work function

- Can we say anything about how message latencies should be modified
following a fusion transformation?

- I think the min function is violated when the tapes are empty.
Should probably look at this and see if there's a way to fix it.

- Also, message constraints are violated when things are empty, since
if you require a certain amount of buffering between two filters, then
there won't be that data until initialization time.  hmm.
