things to do with paper:
------------------------

- modify the tape-labeling diagram to have $n$ streams in a parallel split-join

- get correct typesetting for natural numbers N

things to figure out / solve:
-----------------------------

- I think the min function is violated when the tapes are empty.
Should probably look at this and see if there's a way to fix it.
