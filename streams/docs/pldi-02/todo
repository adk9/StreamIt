things to do with paper:
------------------------

- be consistent about SplitJoin / split-join / split join / splitjoin,
plus capitalization of all stream constructs.

- modify the tape-labeling diagram to have $n$ streams in a parallel split-join

- get correct typesetting for natural numbers N

- add note that the message delivery constraints sometimes specify a
minimum buffer size, sometimes specify a maximum buffer size?

- define a max function in the case of the downstream message sending,
just for the sake of making the explanation clearer (and defining the
max function, so that other people can use it in other papers, and
think about the concept even.)

- abstract away the function composing streams around a path of a
splitjoin?  then could use it again when talking about the
denotational semantics.

things to figure out / solve:
-----------------------------

*** Someone please check the equations.

*** Can we figure out the denotational semantics for a feedback loop?

*** Can we show that fusion preserves the min function across its
inputs?

- Can we say anything about how message latencies should be modified
following a fusion transformation?

- I think the min function is violated when the tapes are empty.
Should probably look at this and see if there's a way to fix it.

- Also, message constraints are violated when things are empty, since
if you require a certain amount of buffering between two filters, then
there won't be that data until initialization time.  hmm.
