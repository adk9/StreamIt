\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We have implemented a fully-functional prototype of the StreamIt
compiler for the Raw architecture; the compiler phases are described
in Table~\ref{tab:stages}. We have implemented all the phases of the
compiler as well as the optimizations except for the optimization
selection, which is currently done by the programmer.



We have evaluated our compiler with StreamIt versions of the following
applications: 
\begin{itemize}

\item A software-based FM Radio with
equalizer, 

\item A GSM Decoder, which takes GSM-encoded parameters as
inputs, and uses these to synthesize audible speech, 

\item A beamformer
which encapsulates the core functionality of modern radar, sonar, and
communications signal processors -- modeled after a system from the
Polymorphic Computing Architecture (PCA) \cite{pca}

\item A 64-element FFT filter implemented as a pipeline of a bit reversal 
filter followed by multiple-stage butterfly filters.


%\item A performance test from the SpectrumWare system that
%implements an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexor (OFDM)
%\cite{spectrumware}.  Table \ref{tab:benchmarks} gives characteristics
%of the above applications including the number of filters implemented
%and the size of the stream graph as coded.

\end{itemize}

In the Table~\ref{tab:performance}, we evaluate the effectiveness of
StreamIt compiler by compiling the above applications on to the Raw
processor. The executables are simulated on either a 4x4 or an 8x8 Raw
processor using Raw's cycle accurate simulator. We show the
performance of the original application, which is run on a processor
configuration with sufficent tiles so that each filter can be mapped
to an individual tile. Next we perform a series of fusion, fisson and
reindexing transformations to create a load balanced set of filters
that can be mapped onto a 4x4 Raw processor.
