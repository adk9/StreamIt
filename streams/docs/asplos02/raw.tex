\section{The Raw Architecture}
\label{sec:raw}

The Raw Microprocessor \cite{raw9}\cite{raw10} addresses the wire
delay \cite{raw13} problem by providing direct instruction set
architecture (ISA) analogs to three underlying physical resources of
the processor: gates, wires and pins. Because ISA primitives exist for
these resources, a compiler like the StreamIt compiler has direct
control over both the computation and the communication of values
between the functional units of the microprocessor, as well as across
the pins of the processor.

The architecture exposes the gate resources as a scalable 2-D array of
identical, programmable tiles, that are connected to their immediate
neighbors by the architectural analog to the wiring resources of the
processor: four, on-chip 32-bit full-duplex, flow-controlled,
point-to-point networks.  On the edges of the array, these networks
are connected via logical channels \cite{raw11} to the pins.  Thus,
values routed through the networks off of the side of the array appear
on the pins, and values placed on the pins by external devices (for
example, wide-word A/Ds, DRAMS, video streams and PCI-X buses) will
appear on the networks.

Each of the tiles contains a compute processor, some memory and two
types of routers -- one static, one dynamic -- that control the flow
of data over the networks as well as into the compute processor, see
Figure \ref{fig:raw-diagram}. The compute processor interfaces to the
network through a bypassed, register-mapped interface \cite{raw10}
that allows instructions to use the networks and the register files
interchangeably. In other words, a single instruction can read up to
two values out of the networks, compute on them, and send the result
out into the networks, with no penalty.  Reads and writes in this
fashion are blocking and flow-controlled, which allows for the
computation to remain unperturbed by unpredictable timing variations
such as cache misses and interrupts.

Each tile's static router sequences through a compile-time programmed,
virtualized instruction memory to control the crossbars of the two
static networks. Collectively, the static routers can reconfigure the
communication pattern across these networks every cycle.  The
instruction set of the static router is a 64-bit VLIW word that
includes a basic instruction that operates on a network value or one
of the local 4-element register file values (conditional branch
with/without decrement, move, and nop). The instruction also has 13
fields that specify the connections between each output of the two
crossbars and the network input FIFOs that store values that have
arrived from the neighbor tiles or the local compute processor.  The
input and output possibilities for each crossbar are: North, East,
West, South, Processor, to the other crossbar, and into the static
router. The FIFOs are typically four or eight elements large.

To route a word from one tile to another, the compiler inserts a route
instruction on every intermediate static router \cite{lee98spacetime}.
Because the routers are pipelined and compile-time scheduled, they can
deliver a value from the ALU of one tile to the ALU of a neighboring
tile in 3 cycles, or more generally, 2+N hops for a inter-tile
distance of N hops.

The results of this paper were generated using btl, a cycle-accurate
simulator that models arrays of Raw tiles identical to those in the
.15 micron 16-tile Raw prototype chip.  This tile employs as compute
processor an 8-stage, single issue, in-order MIPS-style pipeline that
has a 32 KB data cache, 32 KB of instruction memory, and 64 KB of
static router memory. All functional units except the floating point
and integer dividers are fully pipelined. The mispredict penalty of
the static branch predictor is three cycles, as is the load
latency. The compute procesosr's pipelined single-precision FPU
operations have a latency of 4 cycles, and the integer multiplier has
a latency of 2 cycles.


%The Raw Processor is a general-purpose microprocessor being developed
%in the Computer Architecture Group at The Massachusetts Institute of
%Technology.

%The general organization of the Raw Processor is as a chip
%multiprocessor with multiple fine-grain, first-class, register mapped
%communication networks \cite{raw}.  The processor contains a 2-D mesh
%of identical tiles, see Figure \ref{fig:raw-diagram}.  A tile consists
%of a tile processor, memory, two dynamic network routers, two static
%switch crossbars and a static switch processor.  Tiles are connected
%to each of their four nearest neighbors by the two sets of static
%network interconnect and two sets of dynamic network interconnect.
%The tile processor uses a 32-bit MIPS-like instruction set with 32K
%SRAM data memory and 32K SRAM instruction memory.

%The StreamIt Compiler maps the infinite, FIFO channels of the language
%to Raw's static networks.  Each static network routes single-word
%quantities of data (with no header) between the switch processor of
%nearest neighbors.  The tile processor communicates with the switch
%processor using buffered, blocking sends and receives.  The switch
%processors communicate using the same mechanism. Each tile must know
%in advance to whom it is sending data and from whom it is receiving
%data.  It is the task of the compiler to generate the appropriate
%route instructions at compiler time.  The static network allows
%3-cycle nearest neighbor ALU to ALU communication latency.

%The switch processor controls the static networks of the chip.  The
%switch processor uses a stripped down MIPS-like instruction set
%containing only moves and branches.  The switch processor has 4
%registers, an 8096-instruction instruction memory, and no data
%memory. Each switch instruction has a ROUTE component, executed in
%parallel, that specifies the transfer of values on the static network
%between the switch and its neighboring switches.  Each switch
%instruction can execute multiple moves in parallel using a VLIW-like
%instruction encoding for the ROUTE component.  The Raw instruction set
%architecture (ISA) works together with this parallel architecture by
%exposing both the computational and communication resources up to the
%software.

%Currently, the StreamIt Compiler generates code that executes on Raw's
%cycle accurate simulator. The simulator can model Raw configurations
%of up to 8 tiles per side.  During the summer of 2002, a prototype 4x4
%tile Raw chip will be available.  With a target clock rate of 225MHz,
%the chip will support 16 OPS/FLOPS per cycle, 3.6 GLOPS per second,
%and a bisection bandwidth of 230 Gb/sec.
