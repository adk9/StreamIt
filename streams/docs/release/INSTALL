Installing the StreamIt Snapshot
--------------------------------

This is for the March 14, 2003 snapshot release (streamit-0.0.20030314).

$Id: INSTALL,v 1.1 2003-03-10 20:06:00 dmaze Exp $


Unpack the StreamIt source tar file somewhere; this can be in your
home directory, or in a shared directory.  Perform the steps listed in
"per-user setup" below, then log out and log in again (or reload your
shell's dotfiles).  Then:

  cd $STREAMIT_HOME/compiler
  make
  cd $STREAMIT_HOME/library/c
  make

You should now be able to run the compiler.  For a minimal test:

  cd
  cp $STREAMIT_HOME/apps/examples/hello/HelloWorld6.str .
  knit HelloWorld6.str
  ./a.out -i10

This should print the numbers 0 through 9, in order.


PER-USER SETUP: depends on the shell you use; you need to set the
STREAMIT_HOME environment variable and search paths for Java and
LaTeX.  If you use bash, add to your .bashrc file

  export STREAMIT_HOME=$HOME/streamit-0.0.20030314 # or elsewhere
  . $STREAMIT_HOME/include/dot-bashrc

If you use tcsh, add to your .cshrc file

  setenv STREAMIT_HOME ${HOME}/streamit-0.0.20030314
  source ${STREAMIT_HOME}/include/dot-cshrc

Note that this is a snapshot release; in particular, the settings in
the dot-bashrc and dot-cshrc files contain some paths specific to the
MIT LCS CAG local infrastructure.  You may want to edit these files to
set some of the paths to directories more appropriate to your site.

If you want to override the settings the provided scripts set (for
example, the RAW StarSearch directory), set the relevant variables
after reading the dot-bashrc or dot-cshrc file.
