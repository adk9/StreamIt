\section{Open Issues}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Is the hardware model for virtual channels realistic?

\item Is the {\tt ostream.of()} (output full) method really needed?

\item Need to specify the exact function calls for retrieving graph
structure of metadata description.

\item Could improve precision of draining semantics when kernel has a
mixture of static and dynamic rates.

\end{enumerate}
