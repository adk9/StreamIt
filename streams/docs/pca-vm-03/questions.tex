\section{Open Issues}

\begin{itemize}

\item cutting off when you read from a non-blocking stream. Can you
    switch to read from a different channel before the end of the
    stream?

\end{itemize}

\section{Questions for Saman/Peter}

\begin{itemize}

\item is the channel virtualization done right?

\item what is a memory stream again?

\item for buffered streams, are sizes (i.e., total stream length)
declared?

\end{itemize}
