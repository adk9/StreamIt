\begin{enumerate}

\item Not clear what {\tt stream.length()} means if a stream object is
written to by multiple graphs, or especially if it's being

\item Is the hardware model for virtual channels realistic?

\item Need to specify the exact function calls for retrieving graph
structure of metadata description.
