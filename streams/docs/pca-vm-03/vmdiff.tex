\section{Changes from Previous Proposal}

\begin{enumerate}

\item they allow "size of stream" to be a functoin that is called from
within kernels.  seems to me that this is a global property that
should fall outside of a kernel; rather, the size of stream could be
passed into a kernel as a parameter.

\item object-oriented VM.  Shows private data better, fits in well
with C++ constructs.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Rationale}

\begin{verbatim}

reasons not to just use streamc/kernelc
---------------------------------------
- state of the filters is obscured (pass as arguments)
- destroys init function and phase information
- parallelism is obscured and has to be extracted
  - scheduling decisions made before hand

reasons for graph construct instead of just kernels
---------------------------------------------------

- having the graph construct as way of enforcing the inferral
constraints - can gurantee good performance if you have a graph

- to get good performance on a graph, these restrictions have to be
met:

  - have to know the components (which filters) at compile time.  if
    there is ambiguity as to which filters are in the graph, then this
    will hurt performance
