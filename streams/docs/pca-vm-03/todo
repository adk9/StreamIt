- do I need to define the actual API for accessing metadata stuff

- work out metadata description for Raw

- look at scalar operand networks for network characterization stuff

- think about how to remove the speaker from the final example

- note that when you call a method with something that's not it's
type, it finds constructor taking arg

- add special constructors for initializing fields of totalLength,
end, start... er, how do you deal with reset in this case?  just
dealing with length, totalLength returning capacity for a copy kernel.

x decide what processor resource copy operations should execute on

x think about graphs that contain kernels spread out across multiple
processors
