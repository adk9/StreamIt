- more precise draining semantics in the case of dynamic rates.  e.g.,
are dynamic interrupted?  are static-rate kernels atomic?  do you stop
a static-rate kernel in the middle if it will exceed the length
declared?

- deal with loops and initPath

- work out metadata description for Raw

- look at scalar operand networks for network characterization stuff
