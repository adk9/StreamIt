\section{Metadata Description:  Overview of Changes}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Description is a planar graph, not a tree.  For architectures
like raw.

\item Network properties are expressed pairwise, as edges between
nodes, instead of as an interface at the nodes themselves.

\item No distinction between threaded processors and streaming
processors, except for the new ``master'' property.

\item Some properties have been adjusted, as described in detail
below.
