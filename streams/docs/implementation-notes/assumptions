This file contains assumptions that we're making to simplify the
initial implementation of the StreaMIT language, compiler,
applications, and runtime system.  Please mark each assumption in the
proper category, with a date, too.  

Assumptions inherent in the language definition
-----------------------------------------------

8/01	All input and output rates of filters are known at compile
	time.

8/01	There is an upstream or downstream path between the sender of
	a message and the receiver of that message.  For example, you
	can't send a message from one part of a SplitJoin to another.

Compiler / Runtime System
-------------------------

9/01 	There is no re-initialization.  Further, the initialization at
	the beginning of the program can have only one possibility; for
	instance, the stream structure can't depend on a random number
	that's generated in the init function.

9/01	The whole program is available to the compiler.  In
	combination with the above assumption, this implies that the
	entire graph is known statically.

9/19/01	There are no messages sent during initialization.

9/19/01	DUPLICATE splitters allow sources as children.  ROUND_ROBIN splitters
	do not.  ROUND_ROBIN joiners do not allow sinks as parents.
