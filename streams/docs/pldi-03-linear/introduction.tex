\section{Introduction}
As more and more parts of modern life use digital computation, from cell phones to GPS systems
and satellite radio systems, the importance of digitally processing signals is growing.
Each successive generation of applications requires ever more sophisticated algorithms mapped 
on to ever more specialized processors. Since embedded computers have severe performance
requirements placed on them, typically the mapping of algorithm to architecture is done by hand.
When writing optimized assempbly for the latest DSP processors, one has to map the same algorithm
and time again. This remapping is costly arduous process that slows the pace of advance
because it forces engineers to spend time working out details rather than focusing on new technology.

The StreamIt\cite{thies02streamit,thies01streamit,william-stream,michal-common} project
aims to provide a common language and compiler for streaming computations. Streaming computations
are characterized by data streaming in and out of the system while each data element (both
input and output) is in the system for only a small amount of time. 
StreamIt programs are composed of processing blocks called {\tt Filters} which
contain an input tape from which they can read values and an output tape to which
they can write values. {\tt Filters} are composed heirarchally into structures to form
a Stream Graph representation of the program (*need to explain stream graph).
 
{\tt Pipelines} represent the serial computation of one filter after another.
{\tt SplitJoins} represent parallel computation. {\tt FeedbackLoops} allow cycles
to be introduced into the stream graph. Figure~\ref{fig:structures} shows a {\tt Pipeline},
{\tt SplitJoin} and a {\tt FeedbackLoop}. StreamIt programs do not support arbitrary connections
between {\tt Filters} and as such not every stream graph is expressable. Most real world programs
can be fit into the structured stream model, even if it takes some extra manipulation. We believe
that benefits of structure outweigh and costs associated with it.

\subsection{Matrices and Digital Signal Processing}  
We take advantage of StreamIt's one input one output computation blocks and 
our observations that a large class of likely StreamIt programs are performing
digital signal processing functions (eg filtering of the data) to do domain specific
optimizations on the program.

Remember to cite \cite{xiong-thesis,xiong01spl,johnson01searching,egner01automatic} about
past work on automatic matrix factorization and automatic code generation within the 
SPIRAL\cite{spiral} project. Also interesting to note is the work done at UTenn Knoxville 
with the ATLAS package\cite{whaley01automated}.
