high priority
-------------

- note that we require a certain minimum value of e in the expansion
process!

- make sure it's xA + b everywhere instead of xA + a.

low priority
------------

- do we need a word other than dataflow analysis to describe what
we're doing?  It's not really a dataflow analysis.

- make it explicit somewhere that whenever we introduce \lambda_x, we
also introduce A_x, b_x, e_x, o_x, u_x.

(aal - started) I would recommend adding a vector symbol to b
everywhere, or putting A and b in bold everywhere, to note that
they're vectors and distinguish them from constants like e, o, and u.

probably not doing
------------------

- say more about when linear combination is a good thing?  I think the
statement with the sum of non-zero elements is not entirely accurate.
