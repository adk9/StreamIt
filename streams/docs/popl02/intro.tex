\section{Introduction}



dataflow graphs for dsp environments, originally proposed by Lee
modularity
concurency

--

tasks/nodes/actors with arcs/channels between them; data values passed as streams.

can represent large class of dsp computations, speech coding,
auto-correlation, power spectrum, voice band modulation, variety of filters

----

Outline of sections

1. Propose Phased Computation Graph (PCG), that is generalization of
   Computation Graph, SDF, CSDF

2. Show that PCP is equivalent to a SARE 

3. Demonstrate that PCP's can benefit from the vast number of
   techniques that have been developed for SARE's

4. In addition, develop a notion of distributed time using the
   translation, that gives a precise meaning to relative time in
   dataflow graphs.


\begin{itemize}

\item Background on SDF/CSDF and SARE's; how they're comming from
different communities that have been disconnected 'til now.  Review
how landbreaking it was when Feautrier showed static control flow
programs are equivalent to SARE's.

\end{itemize}
