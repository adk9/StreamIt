\section{Basic Translation: SDF to SARE}
\label{sec:simple}

In order to familiarize the reader with the basics of our technique,
we present in this section the translation procedure for a simplified
input domain.  The translation rules for the general case can be found
in Section~\ref{sec:translate}.

Our basic translation operates on synchronous dataflow graphs with all
of the channels initially empty.  That is, we assume that:
\begin{enumerate}

\item No items appear on the channels at the beginning:  $\forall c, A(c) = 0$.

\item There are no initialization phases: $\forall n, \mt{num}(n, \mt{init}) = 0$.

\item Each node has only one steady-state phase: $\forall n, \mt{num}(n, \mt{steady}) = 1$.

\item There is no peeking: $\forall c, \forall t, \forall p, E(c, t, p) = O(c, t, p)$.

\end{enumerate}

Given these restrictions, we can simplify our notation considerably.
Since we are only concerned with the steady-state epoch and the 0'th
phase of each node, we can omit some arguments to any function that
requires an epoch $t$ or a phase $p$.  For instance, the push and pop
rates of a channel $c$ are now just $U(c)$ and $O(c)$, respectively;
the work function for a node $n$ is simply $W(n)$.

\subsection{Calculating the Steady-State Period}
\label{sec:balance}

Let $S(n)$ denote the number of times that node $n$ fires its 0'th
phase for a balanced steady-state execution cycle of the entire
graph. \todo{Say more about this.}

We will use the following helper function.  Given channel $c = (n_a, n_b)$:
\begin{align*}
\mt{Period}(c) \equiv S(n_a) * U(c) = S(n_b) * O(c)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Generating a SARE}

The SARE will be parameterized by $N$, the number of steady-state
cycles that one wishes to execute in the PCP.
