Contributions of paper:

1. Propose Phased Computation Graph (PCG), that is generalization of
   Computation Graph, SDF, CSDF

2. Show that PCP is equivalent to a SARE 

3. Demonstrate that PCP's can benefit from the vast number of
   techniques that have been developed for SARE's

4. In addition, develop a notion of distributed time using the
   translation, that gives a precise meaning to relative time in
   dataflow graphs.
