\section{General Translation: PCP to SARE}
\label{sec:translate}

In this section we give the formal translation of a Phased Computation
Program to a System of Affine Recurrence Equations.  The SARE will be
parameterized by $N$, the number of steady-state cycles that one
wishes to execute in the PCP.

The translation will use helper functions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:helper}:
