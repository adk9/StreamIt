\section{TODO}

\begin{itemize}

\item it's important that N effects the domains, not the variables.

\item can model state in a SARE with a self-loop from one iter to the next.

\item emphasize what is and is not resolvable at compile time.

\item motivation for peeking, phases, init/steady epochs.  Code
example in StreamIt?

\item more background on SARE's -- equivalent to static control flow
programs.

\item emphasize that with more fine-grained specifications of the work
functions, you have powerful fine-grained analysis of whole program.

\item fill in explanation for the equations, balance equations, etc.

\item Need better typesetting - all the figures in a table?

\item Add more SARE references.

\end{itemize}
