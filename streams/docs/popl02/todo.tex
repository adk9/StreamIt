\section{TODO}

\begin{itemize}

\item it's important that N effects the domains, not the variables.

\item explain the sare better:  must define direct elements on the lhs.

\item can model state in a SARE with a self-loop from one iter to the next.

\item emphasize what is and is not resolvable at compile time.

\item motivation for peeking, phases, init/steady epochs.  Code
example in StreamIt?

\item more background on SARE's -- equivalent to static control flow
programs.

\item fill in explanation for the equations, balance equations, etc.

\item Add more SARE references (references in general). 

\item Make the equations look good (JASPER)

\item Example in Appendix - StreamIt Code, Stream / PCG Graph, SARE. (JASPER)

\end{itemize}
